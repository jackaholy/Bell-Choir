# Bell-Choir

## Description

This project is a multi-threaded Java application that simulate a bell choir playing musical instruments, or "bells". This program reads through a file containing notes each with a set duration. Each member of the bell choir is assigned to their own note, and their own thread. When each of these threads are run in sequence, the program creates a song simulating a bell choir.
